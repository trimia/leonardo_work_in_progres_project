<h1 id="file-structure">File Structure</h1>
<p>The file structure in our repository follows a specific convention to ensure consistency and organization. This section provides an overview of the file structure and how it is organized in our codebase.</p>
<p>The file structure is organized into different directories and subdirectories. Each directory serves a specific purpose and contains related files.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>src</code> directory is the main directory that contains all the source code files. Within the <code>src</code> directory, there is a subdirectory called<code>app</code>, which is used to organize different types of code files.</p>
<p>To add a new file to the file structure, follow the existing conventions and place the file in the appropriate directory. This helps maintain a logical and consistent structure throughout the codebase.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the file structure may vary depending on the specific component or module being worked on. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to the relevant code snippets and examples in the repository for a more detailed understanding of the file structure in a specific context.</p>
