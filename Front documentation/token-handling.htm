<p>This code snippet defines an interface called <code>Token</code> with two properties: <code>access_token</code> and <code>refresh_token</code>, both of which are of type string.</p>

<pre><code class="language-tsx">1      export default interface Token{
2          access_token : string,
3          refresh_token : string
4      }
</code></pre>
<br/>

<p>The token is what allows the application to know when a user is logged. Thanks to the communication between front and back end, it gets generated when someone logs in and it gets destroyed when someone logs out</p>
